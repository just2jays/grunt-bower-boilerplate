1. Get Grunt installed

Grunt...is installed on a per-project basis.
Grunt...needs Node and NPM. _Install it first!_

The _package.json_ file in the repo installs grunt for us.
Simply navigate to the project folder in Terminal and running the command:
```javascript
npm install
```

We should also install the Grunt CLI (command line interface) to give us global access to the grunt command from within Terminal.
```javascript
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
(-g = globally)


2. Install important/base grunt plug-ins

Grunt has a ton of great plug-ins to make development easier.
Grunt knows what plug-ins to load and what to do with them via the included _Gruntfile.js_ already in the repo.
